# DisastersDouenne.jl

> Package to replicate "Disaster risks, disaster strikes, and economic growth: the role of preferences" by T. Douenne (2020)

The package replicates the tables 1 to 7 and the figure 1 of the quantitative assessment part. \
We displayed two simple interactive interfaces, by using *Blink.jl*. One for the first table that shows the parameters and another one for the tables and the figure. 
\
**To access the interface, you need to write on the Julia REPL :** 
1) using DisastersDouenne
2) disaster() 

**WARNING 1 : the windows open on top of the other** \
**WARNING 2 : if you click on Figure 1, it might take some time to be displayed. You can go make yourself a very tasteful coffee !**
